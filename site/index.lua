<h1>Welcome to Positive Tutoring!</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Stephen and I'm a tutor for Positive Tutoring. I started Positive Tutoring in order to provide a standard of excellence in tutoring for K-12 subjects and lower division college classes while maintaining a positive environment that fosters curiosity, learning, and personal growth.</p>

<p>Tutoring sessions can be scheduled on an hourly basis. All in person tutoring sessions will be held in a public location (ideally a public library) that can be determined as needed. For convenience I also provide tutoring sessions via Zoom. </p>

<p>Before our first session you can specify which K-12 subjects your child needs help with or what college courses you would like assistance with. That way when we begin after we break the ice we can start focusing on the material you or your child needs to learn. I can also help you come up with game plans for studying and mastering subject material.</p>
